# 🧠 My DSA and Java Learning Plan (Free)

I am learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **Java**.  
I will only use **free problems** from **GeeksforGeeks** and **LeetCode**.  
My goal is to reach **intermediate level** by **December 31, 2025**.

## ✍️ My Note

This is my personal learning plan.  
I want to study daily, track progress, and share what I learn with others.  
I believe small daily steps can make big progress.
