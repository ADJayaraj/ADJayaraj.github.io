## Today's Problem

Link here -> https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/

## Note about today's problem:

I initially struggled with int array initialization and usage. I need to work on improving on such items. The problem was tagged easy. I did write a solution to the problem, but the Time and Space complexity was way more. My code's runtime beat 5.06% and memory beat 10.59% people's code which means I am way too backward. Having said that I think I need to study more about the following items.

1. What is Time and Space complexity? What are the significance? What is the benchmark for that?

## Errors I faced
```java
int[] arr = [0,0]; // This is not at all allowed

arr.add(0) // Such a method was not at all available

int[] arr = null;
arr[0] = a; // I ran into NullPointerException with this, because I initialized the array arr with null; - See error message below

java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot store to int array because "<local5>" is null at line 18, Solution.twoSum at line 56, __DriverSolution__.__helper__ at line 89, __Driver__.main


int[] arr = new int [2]; // The right way to initialize (with size)
int[] arr = new int []; // Without size 
int[] arr = new int [] {1,2}; // With initial values
arr = {1,2,3,4,5}; // Later add values
arr[0] = 1; // Set
```
