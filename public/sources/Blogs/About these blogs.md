I am a fan of Obsidian and I am using it for a while. I already know GitHub pages exist and know how it works. I have recently started improving myself and one such improvement step is learning. Few weeks back, I started using daily.dev and it is just awesome. I just thought today, "What if I learn something daily and post it out for collaborative learning?". And this site is the result.

Thanks,
Johnson
